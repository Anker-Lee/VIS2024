The plot follows the intertwining stories of various Los Angeles criminals. In one sequence, two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, work for mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Their mission is to retrieve a briefcase with unknown contents. After executing their job at an apartment, Jules and Vincent are nearly killed by a hidden gunman, but they miraculously survive. Jules interprets this as divine intervention and decides to retire. The two visit a diner later, which becomes the setting for another narrative thread.

Simultaneously, we follow the storyline of Butch Coolidge, a boxer paid by Marsellus to throw a fight. Butch, however, bets on himself to win, kills his opponent, and runs, knowing he's now a target. He then has to return to his apartment to retrieve a precious family heirloom â€“ a watch with a storied past. 

In another story thread, Vincent is tasked by Marsellus to escort his wife, Mia Wallace, for an evening. The date takes them to a 1950s-themed diner where they participate in a dance contest and win a trophy. Upon returning to Wallace's house, Mia mistakenly snorts heroin, thinking it's cocaine, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to his dealer's house, where they save her life with an adrenaline shot to the heart.

Butch, en route to retrieve his watch, kills Vincent at his apartment in self-defense. Later, while escaping on a chopper, he finds an injured Marsellus being assaulted in a pawnshop. Butch saves Marsellus, and they call a truce. Butch leaves LA with his girlfriend, Fabienne, as per Marsellus's condition.

Back at the diner, Jules and Vincent find themselves caught in a robbery initiated by the small-time criminals "Pumpkin" and "Honey Bunny," the same diner they're visiting. Jules, now on a path of righteousness, diffuses the situation by allowing the robbers to take the cash and leave, sparing their lives. 

Jules and Vincent leave the diner, reflecting on the day's chaotic events, which have led each of them to moments of epiphany and change.
