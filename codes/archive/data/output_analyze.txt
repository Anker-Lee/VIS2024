His motivations revolve around his code of ethics, professional loyalty to Marsellus Wallace, and ultimately, his spiritual awakening. His strength is his confidence and ability to navigate the criminal underworld, while his weakness lies in his violent tendencies and initial moral ambiguity. Throughout the story, Jules experiences a significant transformation, moving towards redemption after he interprets a life-threatening situation as divine intervention.


2. Character Relationships: The screenplay showcases evolving relationships characterized by power dynamics, loyalty, and personal growth. Jules and Vincent have a partnership built on professional respect, highlighted by their philosophical banter and contrasting outlooks.

Additionally, Butch's relationship with Marsellus evolves from adversarial to one of mutual understanding after a harrowing shared experience.


3. Major Events: Primary events include the accidental shooting of Marvin by Vincent, the overdose of Mia and her subsequent revival by Vincent, Butch's boxing match and the betrayal of the fix, as well as Jules' spiritual epiphany during the diner robbery. Each event drives character development and interweaves the fates of the protagonists towards the climax.
