    "snippets": ["If I could, I would write down my remorse and sorrow, for Zijun and for myself.\nThe forgotten ramshackle house in the Guild Hall [2] in the middle of nowhere is so silent and empty. Time flies, It has been a year since I loved Zijun and escaped from this silence and emptiness through her. By coincidence, when I came back to the house, all that was empty was this house.\nI came back to this house, and it was the only one that was empty. There was still this broken window, this half-dying acacia tree and old wisteria vine, this square window in front of the square table in front of the window, the wall, and the bed against the wall are still the same. Lying alone in bed in the dead of night\nJust as before I had lived with Zijun, the time of the past year was all wiped out, all gone, and I hadn't I didn't move out of this shabby house and create a small, hopeful family in Jizhao Hutong.\nNot only that. A year ago, this silence and emptiness was not like this, but often contained anticipation; anticipation of the arrival of my son. gentleman's arrival. In the agitation of long waiting, the sound of the high soles of shoes touching the brick road, how it made me\nI was suddenly enlivened by the sound of the high soles of my shoes touching the brick pavement! Then I saw the pale round face with the smile, the pale thin arms, the striped cloth striped cloth, and a basil-colored skirt. She brought the new leaves of the half-dying acacia tree outside the window, so that I could see it, and a room hanging on the iron-like trunk of the\nthe old iron-like trunks, and the purple and white flowers of the vines that hung from room to room.\nNow, however, only the silence and emptiness remain, but Zijun will never come again, and always, forever! ......\nWhen Zijun was not in my broken house, I could see nothing. In the midst of my boredom, I grabbed a book in my hand, science or literature, or whatever; read on, read on, and suddenly I felt to myself that I had already turned over\nSuddenly, I felt that I had already turned more than ten pages, but I did not remember what was said in the book. But my ears were unusually alert, as if I could hear the sound of all the traffic outside the gate, from which I could hear the sound of all the traffic.\nI could hear all the sounds of footsteps outside the gate, and among them was Zijun's, which was approaching gradually, but often faded away, and finally disappeared into other steps.\nand disappeared into the clatter of other footsteps. I detested the son of Long Ban, who wore cloth-soled shoes, and who did not sound like Zijun's shoes.\nI hate the son of Long Ban who wears cloth-soled shoes that don't sound like Zijun's shoes, and I hate the little thing in the neighboring yard who wears new shoes and puts on snow cream that sounds too much like Zijun's shoes!\nIs it possible that she flipped the car? Could she have been hit by a trolley? ......\nI would have taken my hat and gone to see her, but her uncle had scolded me to my face. ", "Suddenly, the sound of her shoes came nearer and nearer, one step louder than the next, and when I went out to meet her, she was already walking under the wisteria trellis, with a smiling dimple on her face. She was at her uncle's house about the same time she was at her uncle's. She had not been angry at her uncle's house; my heart was at ease, and after a few moments of silent staring at each other, the house was falling apart. After a few moments, the house gradually filled with the sound of my voice, talking of the tyranny of the family, of the breaking of old habits, of the equality of men and women, of Ivorian I talked of the tyranny of the family, of the breaking of old habits, of equality between men and women, of Emmerson, of Tagore, of Shelley [4]....... She always smiled and nodded her head, her eyes filled with a childlike with a childish curiosity in her eyes. On the wall was nailed a copper-plate bust of Shelley, cut out of a magazine, one of the most beautiful of his most beautiful likeness. When I pointed it out to her, she took only a cursory glance at it and looked down, seemingly embarrassed. In all these places, Zijun had probably not yet shed the fetters of her old ideas--I thought later on that it would be better to change the picture for one of Shelley's drowned in the sea. I also thought later that it would be better to change a picture of Shelley drowned in the sea or a picture of Yimo Sheng; but I finally did not change it, and now I don't even know where this one has gone. Now I don't even know where this one has gone. \"I am my own, and none of them have the right to interfere with me!\" This was after we had been socializing for six months, and talking about her uncle here and her father at home, when she meditated a moment after which the words came out distinctly, firmly, and quietly. It was the time when I had said all I could about my opinions, my life, my shortcomings, and very little concealed; and she was fully acquainted with them. These few words shook my soul, and for many days afterward, and I could not tell you how much I rejoiced to know that Chinese women were not so helpless as the misogynists had said, and that they were not far off in the future. I knew that Chinese women were not as incapable as the misanthropists had said, and that in the near future, they would see the dawn of glory. I sent her out, as usual, about ten paces away; as usual, the old catfish-bearded thing's face was pressed against the dirty windowpane again, and even the tip of his nose was on the windowpane. \nwindowpane, even the tip of his nose squeezed into a small plane; and in the outer yard, as usual, the face of the little thing in the bright glass window, thickened with the little thing's face, thickened with snow cream. She went away proudly without seeing; I came back proudly. I am my own, and none of them have any right to interfere with me!"]
